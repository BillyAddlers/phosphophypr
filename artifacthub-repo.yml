# This file is completely optional, but if you want to index your image on https://artifacthub.io/ you can, by
# adding the Repository ID and your data there on `owners`. This makes it so we can all have a fancy index of all custom
# images. If you dont want to be on that, dont worry, this should not do anything by itself
